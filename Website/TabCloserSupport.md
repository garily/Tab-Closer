# Tab Closer

Tab Closer is a Safari Extension that helps closing Safari tabs to a specific direction (i.e., left or right).

## Usage
Once installed, clicking the Tab Closer icon ![](TabCloserIcon.svg) will bring up a Popover window, in which two buttons are available: a Close Left button "↤" (or "<-|") and a Close Right button "↦" (or "|->"). Click either of the button to close all tabs to the specified direction of the current active tab.
